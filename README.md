## Description
This repository holds the final project for our CS301 class at Lafayette College: Principles of Programming Languages. The assignment is to
demonstrate an assigned programming language to the class in the form of a strategic game and examples. Our assigned language was Scala. Our game of choice was Blackjack, a popular casino game where the player plays against a dealer. The player's goal is to get as close as possible to a 21 hand value, with Ace-K, Ace-J, Ace-Q, Ace-10 being automatc winning blackjack hands. Further details of the game are below.

## Installations
The IDE we used for this project is Intellij by JetBrains, and we encourage you to download it to run the examples in the IDE.
You can download IntelliJ here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download. 

To set up a Scala project within IntelliJ, consult this site: https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started-intellij-track/getting-started-with-scala-in-intellij.html

If you just want to run our code, you would select "open project" after opening IntelliJ and select either the Blackjack directory or ProgrammingModel for the various Scala examples. Make sure the Scala sdk and Java jdk are configured after loading in the project. The Scala sdk can be downloaded within the IDE. You may need to set the ./src folder as "sources root" and add Scala framework support to the project by right clicking on the toplevel project folder, click "Add Framework Support" and select Scala. When chosing the library, you can download the Scala sdk in this step. You will want to restart the IDE after accomplishing all of this.
