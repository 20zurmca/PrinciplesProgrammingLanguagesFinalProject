## Description
This repository holds the final project for our CS301 class at Lafayette College: Principles of Programming Languages. The assignment is to
demonstrate an assigned programming language to the class in the form of a strategic game and examples. Our game of choice was Blackjack,
a popular casino game where the player plays against a dealer. The player's goal is to get as close as possible to a 21 hand value, with
Ace-K, Ace-J, Ace-Q, Ace-10 being automatc winning blackjack hands. Further details of the game are below.
